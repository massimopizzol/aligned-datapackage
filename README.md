## aligned-datapackage

Using the frictionless framework to create data packages, resources, and schema for Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data generated in the ALIGNED project.


### (Wait, I am not a programmer!)

You can still use the material in this repository. All files can be opened and edited manually using a text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.). You can modify the schema.json, datapackage.json, and resource.json files manually and use them as a starting point for documenting your data.

## About this repository


- Includes code and templates to share, report, and document LCI data. 

- Is designed primarily for foreground LCI data, i.e. new primary data about the product and biosphere exchanges of a relatively restricted number of activities, ideally linked to a background database of secondary data. 

- Is based on the [frictionless standards](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/) for describing data. The python scripts use the [frictionless framework](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/) and related libraries.

- Uses the LCI data format decribed in detail in this [ALIGNED T1.2 LCI data template zenodo archive](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10843472). This tabular format mirrors the nomenclature and fields used in the [Brightway2](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/) open LCA software framework.

- It is intended for both python and non-python users.

- Targets as primary audience the Life Cycle Assessment and Industrial Ecology communities. 

- Allows to include GLAD metadata. GLAD is the [Global LCA Data Access Network](https://www.globallcadataaccess.org/).


## Structure of the repository


Folder [aligned-schema](https://github.com/massimopizzol/aligned-datapackage/tree/main/aligned-schema): 

- includes a base schema for the LCI data format, the same documented in the [ALIGNED T1.2 LCI data template zenodo archive](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10843472).

-  In plain words, a [schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#concepts) is here intended as a description of each column of a table of data. This allows to understand the type of data and what is contained in the table of data. 

-  This schema includes only the recommended minimal number of fields to be used to share LCI data. Other fields can be added if needed.

-  Once you have put your LCI data in table format, use this schema to document their structure.

Folder [example-package](https://github.com/massimopizzol/aligned-datapackage/tree/main/example-package):

- Is essentially a template for a [datapackage](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#language) of LCI data.
- Includes a ```datapackage.json``` file, a ```schema.json``` file, and the data (in this context called "resources", in practice these are .csv files) in a separate subfolder. 
- It is thus compliant with the [frictionless framework recommended structure](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#illustrative-structure)
- The ```datapackage.json```file specifies which data are included in the package and provides metadata such as author, license, contributors, sources, and description.
- Use this folder as a template to organize and document the LCI data that you have.


Folder [code-and-examples](https://github.com/massimopizzol/aligned-datapackage/tree/main/code-and-examples):

- Is primarily for python users.

- Uses pythorn libraries from the [frictionless framework](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/). 

- Contains code that can be used to create descriptors for schema, datapackage, and resources.

- In particular [create-resource-with-glad-metadata.py](https://github.com/massimopizzol/aligned-datapackage/blob/main/code-and-examples/create-resource-with-glad-metadata.py) shows how to add GLAD metadata to a LCI tabular resource.

## How to use

The suggested procedure is:

1. Download a copy of the [example-package](https://github.com/massimopizzol/aligned-datapackage/tree/main/example-package) folder. 

2. Prepare LCI data in tabular format using information in the [zenodo archive]() or in the ```aligned-schema.json``` file, example tables available in the repository [aligned-converter](https://github.com/massimopizzol/aligned-converter) repository or in the [example-package/data](https://github.com/massimopizzol/aligned-datapackage/tree/main/example-package/data) folder. Save the files in .csv format in the ```Data``` subfolder.

4. If needed, based on the tabular structure of the data modify manually the ```schema.json``` file or create one automatically as shown in [create-schema.py](https://github.com/massimopizzol/aligned-datapackage/blob/main/code-and-examples/create-schema.py)

5. Modify manually the datapackage.json file or create one automatically as shown in [create-datapackage-with-metadata.py](https://github.com/massimopizzol/aligned-datapackage/blob/main/code-and-examples/create-datapackage-with-metadata.py) and add minimal metadata such as name, description, licenses, contributors... 

6. Optionally (but recommended!) create a resource descriptor for each data file using the GLAD metadata fields. See [create-resource-with-glad-metadata.py](https://github.com/massimopizzol/aligned-datapackage/blob/main/code-and-examples/create-resource-with-glad-metadata.py)

7. Share the data in a repository.


### At this point you will have LCI data:

- Formatted in a way that can be imported in open source LCA software. 

- Whose format is clearly documented in a schema, that can be used to validate the datasets and detect errors but also to properly read the data.

- Organized in files and directories with a standard structure.

- Shared and accesible to others (if in a public repository).

- That include the essential metadata as well as domain-specific GLAD metadata that are recognized by, and relevant for, the LCA community.
